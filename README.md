# Arsteakskan language reference, yo!

### tl;dr:
 * **Arsteakskan** is a fork of Chinese for Chinese and English speakers. It's
 meant to serve as a third auxiliary language for, like, if you want to look
 cool or something!

 * Chinese words and grammar remain largely the same.

 * It's pretty much a series of systems for representing written Chinese and
 English using [Bopomofo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo), with a few
 Japanese words thrown in.

 * There's going to be a lot of cat references coming up. _Be warned._

### Bopomofo
**Bopomofo** is a character system designed to represent sounds in Chinese.
In Arsteakskan, it can be used to represent sounds in Chinese _and English,_
and can also be substituted for entire Chinese characters, English words, or transliterated names.

Onomatopoeia is almost exclusively represented as Bopomofo, as well as a few
Arsteakskan-specific words which do not exist in Chinese or English.
